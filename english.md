# Better Schedule

This is faster and less confusing schedule client for Bakaláři. I created this app,
because I am annoyed by the slowness of the the official app.

## Main features

- Very fast schedule loading — Combines offline and online data to display schedule within a second.
- Seamless offline mode — Everything is cached in the background so that schedule can be shown even when you are offline.
- Persistent notification — You don't have to open the app to see next lesson any more.
- Beautiful widget — The next lesson or overview of the entire day always on your home screen.
- Simple interface — Easy switching between weeks.
- Free and open source software — No ads, no spying, free, forever.

## Coming soon

- More themes (dark, black & white, ...)
- Your suggestions on GitHub — https://github.com/vitSkalicky/lepsi-rozvrh/issues
